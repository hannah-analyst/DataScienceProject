## Project background

I am very passionate about the environment and what we as humans can do to protect it. Research has shown that following a vegan diet causes less harm to the planet than a traditional meat and dairy-based diet, due to various factors such as less land space required for raising animals, less water required for processing meat and dairy, fewer CO2 emissions, etc. Studies have also shown an increase in the number of people globally following a vegan diet, which would lead to less harm to the environment should this trend continue. An increase in 'veganism' would suggest a decrease in the meat supply required given that fewer people are eating meat. But can this be predicted? This project will attempt to answer the question: 

### "Has global meat supply increased over time despite the increased prevalance of vegan diets, and can future meat supply be predicted?"

Being able to predict the meat supply required would lead to better comprehension of the harmful effects caused by raising and eating meat, and therefore better understanding of what state of the environment would be in after a certain amount of time.
