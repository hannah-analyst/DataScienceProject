# PORTFOLIO IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## About me
I have a big interest in all things data, and how it can be used to shape decisions!

## My interests
I started playing netball over a decade ago while at high school, and have been part of a team ever since. I always look forward to our weekly matches, and am interested in the prevalence of the sport outside of my netball bubble.

## The data
If I manage to find a good dataset about netball, I will talk about it here.
In the meantime, here is a tiny dummy dataset so that I can test using tables and other markdown features.

| Team name     | Wins   | Losses|
| ------------- |:------:| -----:|
| Team A        | 9      | 2     |
| Team B        | 5      | 6     |
| Team C        | 2      | 9     |
