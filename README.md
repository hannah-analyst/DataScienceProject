## About me
I am a Data & Insights analyst working in the public sector, using analysis and visualisation tools to assist and drive data-led decisions.

I graduated in 2019 with a degree in maths and french, having studied various applied and pure maths topics, as well as spending a year living in France and learning maths at a french university! My first subsequent role was as a data analyst, with a focus on customer base profiling and pricing analysis. I moved a few years later into my current role where my focus is around improving processes to reach KPI targets and scrutiny of the public sector area that I work in.

Alongside this I am currently undertaking a degree apprenticeship in Data Science, in which I am learning new programs to conduct analyses as well as developing understanding of how data science can be implemented in the modern world.

## My interests
Outside of work, I am a keen sports player! Alongside standard gym fitness, I love to play netball - at nearly 6 feet tall it is a great use for my height! I am also passionate about the environment and the negative effects that human beahviours are causing to the climate, which has been the topic of one of my first data science projects. I love to learn about new ideas, and through my ongoing apprenticeship hope to hone my new skills and put them into useful practice in and out of the workplace.
